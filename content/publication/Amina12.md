# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In this paper we introduce a new multi-agent based approach with which a 2D image could be segmented into itâ€™s connected homogeneous regions. it consists in an adaptive approach in the sense that it does not need neither thresholds nor calibration. Moreover, the approach is robust and is stable against the presence of noise in the image. It can be included as it is in  classical  image  processing  systems,  while  being  a  new  approach  to  enhance  as  a  perspective  toward  a  self-adaptive  artificial  vision  system.  Experiment  results  on  synthetic and  real  images  have  shown  that  the  approach  is  well  appropriate  to  image  segmentation without any kind of parameter learning."
